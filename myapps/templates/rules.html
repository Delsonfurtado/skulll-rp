            <h2>General Rules</h2>

            <h3><strong>1. Respect Everyone</strong></h3>
            <p>Treat others the way you'd like to be treated. Whether in-character or out-of-character (OOC), respect is key. Discrimination, harassment, and hate speech are not tolerated.</p>

            <h3><strong>2. Stay in Character</strong></h3>
            <p>When in a roleplay session, always stay in character. Keep real-world knowledge separate from your character’s knowledge to maintain immersion.</p>

            <h3><strong>3. Powergaming</strong></h3>
            <p>Don’t force your actions onto other players. Give them a chance to respond and avoid using unrealistic mechanics for an unfair advantage.</p>

            <h3><strong>4. Metagaming</strong></h3>
            <p>OOC information should never influence your in-game decisions. Keep things immersive and fair.</p>

            <h3><strong>5. Random Deathmatching (RDM)</strong></h3>
            <p>Do not attack or kill other players without a valid roleplay reason. Every violent action must fit within the story.</p>

            <h3><strong>6. Vehicle Deathmatching (VDM)</strong></h3>
            <p>Using vehicles to harm other players without proper roleplay justification is not allowed.</p>

            <h3><strong>7. Play Fair – No Mods or Hacks</strong></h3>
            <p>Cheating, hacking, or exploiting glitches for an advantage is strictly prohibited.</p>

            <h3><strong>8. Keep it Realistic</strong></h3>
            <p>Ensure your character behaves realistically according to the roleplay scenario.</p>

            <h3><strong>9. Value Your Character's Life</strong></h3>
            <p>Your character should act as if their life has real consequences. Reckless behavior without consideration for survival is discouraged.</p>
            
            <h3><strong>10.New Life Rule (NLR)</strong></h3>
            <p>If your character dies, they can’t remember what led to their death. Don’t return to the spot or seek revenge—let it be a fresh start..</p>

            <h3><strong>11.Create Unique Characters</strong></h3>
            <p>Your characters should each have their own backstory and personality. It makes the roleplay richer and more interesting for everyone.</p>

            <h3><strong>12. Hostage Situations</strong></h3>
            <p>If you find yourself in a hostage roleplay, play it seriously. Both the captors and the hostage should act in ways that reflect the stress and gravity of the situation.</p>

            <h3><strong>13. Crime and Law Enforcement</strong></h3>
            <p>Crimes in the game should be thought out and realistic. Looting police stations is off-limits, and you should always respect the role of law enforcement in the game. 
            Corruption by law enforcement characters is not allowed. A maximum of five individuals are permitted to participate in any criminal situation (5-man Rule).</p>
            
            <h3><strong>14. Roleplay Growth</strong></h3>
            <p>Let your characters grow naturally over time. Avoid sudden or unexplained changes in their behavior or skills without a good roleplay reason</p>

            <h3><strong>15. Use In-Game Channels Properly</strong></h3>
            <p>Stick to in-character (IC) communication in the game’s channels, and only use OOC chat for necessary clarifications. Keeping these separate helps maintain the immersion.</p>

            <h3><strong>16. Accord to Admins</strong></h3>
            <p>Admins and moderators are here to help things run smoothly. Follow their instructions and respect their decisions—they’re here to keep the fun going for everyone.</p>

            <h3><strong>17. Reporting Issues</strong></h3>
            <p>If you see someone breaking the rules, report it to an admin rather than handling it yourself. We’ve got a process to keep things fair and confidential.</p>

            <h3><strong>18. Appeal Process</strong></h3>
            <p>If you’ve been banned, there’s a way to appeal. Follow the process, and respect the final decision, whether it goes your way or not.</p>

            <h3><strong>19. Events and Spontaneous Roleplay</strong></h3>
            <p>Major events have their own set of rules, so be sure to follow them. We also encourage spontaneous roleplay as long as it fits the server’s overall story.</p>
        
            <h3><strong>20. Fair Play and No Abuse</strong></h3>
            <p>Abuse of any kind, whether it’s harassment, cheating, exploiting bugs, or using offensive language, won’t fly here. Play fair, respect others, and keep the experience enjoyable for everyone.</p>
            
            <h3><strong>21. Combat Logging & Storing</strong></h3>
            <p>Combat logging is when a player in an active situation quits the server, intentionally to avoid continuing the situation. Combat storing is considered when a player stores their cash, 
            inventory, or vehicle during an active roleplay situation</p>

            <h3><strong>22. RULESPLAINING</strong></h3>
            <p>Do not explain the rules in character. “You’re not really valuing your life right now”, “I have a gun to your head, ahahahaha. 
            This guy.” There are better ways to handle this, “I’m gonna shoot you in the head if you keep moving”. Report people who break rules and those who don’t value their life—shoot them, 
            then report them. Do not ruin your RP experience for people who break the rules—admins will sort them out.</p>
